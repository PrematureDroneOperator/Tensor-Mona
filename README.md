# 🌐 Tensor-Mona

A sleek, responsive mine early warning system built with modern web technologies and a vision for safety, clarity, and speed. Inspired by the **Frutiger Aero** aesthetic—clean gradients, fluid motion, and intuitive design.

---

## ✨ Features

- Real-time sensor dashboard
- Animated UI transitions (Framer Motion / Tailwind)
- Modular architecture for frontend, backend, and ML
- Designed for clarity and urgency in critical environments

---

## 🎨 Theme

Styled with **Frutiger Aero** principles:
- Gradients: `from-cyan-900 via-emerald-600 to-lime-300`
- Typography: Clean sans-serif (suggested: Inter, Frutiger, or similar)
- Animations: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and alert pulses

---

## 🚀 Frontend

Built with **React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion**

### Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Animations

- **Sensor cards**: Fade-in and pulse on alert
- **Navigation bar**: Slide-in on scroll
- **Alerts**: Shake + glow effect for critical warnings

### Preview

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

> Clone the UI and customize it for your deployment needs. Designed to be modular and extendable.

---

## 🛠️ Backend

**Coming Soon**

- FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis
- Celery for async task handling
- RESTful endpoints for sensor data ingestion and alert dispatch

> Backend will be optimized for real-time performance and fault tolerance.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning

**Built using ScKitLearn, pandas, etc**
**Complete Pipeline Integration soon...**
- Time-series forecasting for mine activity
- Anomaly detection using transformer-based models
- Synthetic + real-world dataset validation

> ML pipeline will be modular and pluggable into the backend via API.
